# Up through 2026-05-07, every elite-passing parcel passed *negative*

# That left an entire class of false positives - large vacant lots that
# are actually school playing fields, municipal yards, parkettes, ROW
# slivers - slipping through because no single negative filter caught
# them. The structural fix flips the burden: a parcel only enters
# elite if it AFFIRMATIVELY looks residential.
#
# A parcel passes the positive-residential check if either:
#   (a) Has a building footprint (cover ≥ POSRES_MIN_COVER) - confirms
#       a structure exists, AND lot is in normal residential range
#       (≤ POSRES_MAX_LOT_AREA_M2); OR
#   (b) Vacant (cover = 0) BUT lot ≤ POSRES_VACANT_MAX_LOT_AREA_M2
#       (typical residential vacant). Bigger vacant lots are
#       overwhelmingly institutional in Toronto's residential zones.
#
# Real multiplex teardown candidates fit (a). Genuine vacant residential
# lots are rare in Toronto and almost always under 2000 m². Anything
# larger and unbuilt is a school field, parkette, or municipal holding.

    # Laneway-suite-permit back-derivation (added 2026-05-12). Toronto

    # Fairbank back-lanes; the laneway-suite permit set is independent
    # ground truth (every laneway suite must abut a real lane by the

    # Two-stage flip:
