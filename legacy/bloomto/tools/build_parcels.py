"""Offline ETL orchestrator for the parcel-level Multiplex Readiness view.

Composes the v1.2 source modules (heritage, building_outlines, massing, plus
extensions to ttc/streets/solar_to/zoning) into a single per-parcel score
and emits `data/parcels.geojson` atomically.

This is the parcel sibling of `tools/build_neighborhoods.py` - same shape:
CLI in, GeoJSON out, no PHP, no plugin, no build step. Run on a workstation
only (downloads ~1.4 GB of cached data and may peak at ~1 GB resident memory
during the per-parcel loop).

Run:
    python3 tools/build_parcels.py
    python3 tools/build_parcels.py --out data/parcels.geojson
    python3 tools/build_parcels.py --include-non-eligible    # keep score==0 parcels

    2026-05-11 third rewrite. Prior rules (largest-overlap, then centroid-

    Toronto's Property Boundaries polygons for those parcels are mis-drawn
    enough that the neighbour's apartment-block footprint AND centroid sit
    inside the wrong polygon. Geometry algorithms reading the polygon as
    truth will be wrong as long as the polygon is wrong.

    The data-source fix: Address Points are an independent city dataset
    that records WHERE the front door of each address is located. They
    don't suffer from the boundary drift that affects Property Boundaries.
    For each candidate building, ask "where is the nearest registered
    address to this building's centroid?" If that address sits inside
    THIS parcel's polygon, the building belongs here. If it sits in a
    neighbour's polygon, the building belongs to the neighbour - even if
