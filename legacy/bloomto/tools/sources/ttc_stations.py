"""TTC subway-station institutional exclusion.

Catches parcels that are TTC subway-station infrastructure (station boxes,
entrances, headhouses, surface kiosks). The Toronto Property Boundaries
dataset assigns civic addresses to these - e.g., "22 Chester Ave" is
Chester Station - so they slip through the existing institutional ETL
(`tools/sources/institutions.py`) which only pulls schools / parks /
places-of-worship / fire-police-ambulance / LTC / child-care / libraries /
parks-and-rec / community-facilities.

## Approach

Use the GTFS subway-stops point set (already cached and loaded - 148 points
across ~75 stations) and buffer each point by `STATION_BUFFER_M` (30m). A
parcel intersecting any buffered point is treated as TTC infrastructure and
excluded from the wire.

30m is the smallest radius that still catches every observed false-positive
elite parcel from the 2026-05-05 audit (worst case: 22 Chester Ave at 7m
from a stop). Tighter than 30m starts missing subway-station headhouses set
back from the platform stop; looser starts catching truly-residential
corner lots adjacent to stations.

## Limitation (not 100% - documented)

Point + buffer is heuristic. The authoritative source would be TTC station
POLYGONS, but Toronto Open Data's `ttc-subway-shapefile` (resource
7d68bb52-3285-45d7-a248-7748cb47f6ce) is route-line-only and doesn't
publish station polygons. Future improvement: swap to a station-polygon
source if/when one is published. For now, the 30m buffer minimizes the
false-positive rate at the cost of occasionally excluding a corner-lot
residential parcel that genuinely abuts a station - acceptable trade given
the alternative was 22 Chester Ave ranked #1 multiplex pick.

## Wire impact

No new wire field - this is a hard-exclusion gate. `meta.stats` gains
`skippedTtcStation` so a rebuild can verify how many parcels the gate
caught. Mirrors the institutional-exclusion pattern in
`tools/build_parcels.py` for consistency.
