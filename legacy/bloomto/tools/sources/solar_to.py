"""Compute `heat_pump` (share of rooftops with above-75th-percentile annual kWh,
expressed 0–100) per neighborhood from the SolarTO city-wide rooftop dataset.

Also exposes the v1.2 building blocks `compute_solar_points` (STRtree + parallel
kWh array, used by parcel scoring) and `kwh_p95` (citywide 95th-percentile kWh,
used to normalize per-parcel solar to 0–100). Note: `kwh_p95` is **not** the
statistic used by `compute_heat_pump` - that uses an internal P75. The two
percentiles serve different scoring layers (P75 for the neighborhood-level
heat-pump share, P95 for the parcel-level raw solar score).

SolarTO upstream rooftop screening (City of Toronto, applied SOURCE-side
before kWh values are published - BloomTO inherits these gates transitively):
  - Roof surface must receive >=800 kWh/m^2/yr incident solar radiation
  - Roof surface must have >=30 m^2 of clear, usable space
  - Slope must be < 45 degrees
  - Aspect must NOT be north-facing
  - Toronto yield factor: 1 kW installed PV -> ~1,150 kWh/yr generated

So every kWh value in the SolarTO CSV represents a roof surface that already
clears all four screening gates. BloomTO does NOT re-apply these filters -
they're respected transitively because the source already filtered. The
methodology is surfaced on the wire as `meta.solarMethodology` for honest
disclosure, and in `goldmines.html` info card so users see what's behind
their `solarScore`.

See `tools/README.md` § SolarTO Source for the locked CSV schema.
