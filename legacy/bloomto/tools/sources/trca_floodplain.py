"""TRCA Regulated Area (Ont. Reg. 41/24) - riverine flood + valley + wetland overlay.

Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) regulates development on
riverine floodplains, hazardous slopes, and provincially-significant
wetlands under Ontario Regulation 41/24 (formerly O. Reg. 166/06). The
regulatory limit polygon is the union of:
- Floodplain (regulatory storm flood elevation)
- Meander belt (river migration corridor)
- Erosion / steep-slope hazard
- Wetlands (Provincially Significant)
- Watercourse setbacks (typically 30m from top-of-bank)

A parcel intersecting this regulated area requires TRCA approval before any
development - building permits are rarely granted on floodplain land for new
residential. This is the discriminating buy/no-buy flood signal devs need;
the basement-flooding-study-areas dataset (`tools/sources/flood.py`) flags
combined-sewer service zones (universal across BloomTO's emit set), but
TRCA Regulated Area carries the actual permit gate.

The download endpoint is async - POSTing/GETting the export URL returns 202
with a job-status JSON until the export completes (~30-60s on TRCA's side),
then 302-redirects to the cached GeoJSON. Polygons are published in
EPSG:26917 (UTM Zone 17N) and are reprojected to EPSG:4326 in-process.

Per parcel: representative-point inside any regulated polygon → set
`inRegulatedArea = True`. Mirrors flood.py's API shape so build_parcels.py
consumes both layers identically.
