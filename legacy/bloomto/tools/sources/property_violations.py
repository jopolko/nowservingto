"""Building Construction / Demolition Violations - daily-refreshed CKAN feed.

The ML&S (Municipal Licensing & Standards) division issues these against
property owners for unpermitted construction, unsafe structures, stop-work
violations, and similar enforcement actions. A multiplex dev reading this
feed sees owners under City pressure - strongest "motivated seller" signal
publicly available.

Filtering scope:
- `STATUS` is one of the *active* enforcement states:
  - `Order Issued` (the bulk of distress)
  - `Stop Work Order Issued` (active construction halted)
  - `Unsafe Order Issued` (building deemed unsafe)
  - `Notice Issued` (formal notice)
  - `Prosecution Initiated` (escalated to court)
- Drops `Closed`, `Order Complied`, `Cancelled`, `Rescheduled`, etc.
- Optional date filter via `since_iso` to scope to recent filings.

CKAN refresh cadence: **daily**. Dataset has ~48K rows total - historic +
active. Filtering trims to ~3K active distress signals citywide.
