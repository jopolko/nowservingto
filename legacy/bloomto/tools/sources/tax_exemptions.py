"""Toronto tax-rebate / exemption institutional-address source.

Loads Toronto's "Tax Rebates - Tax Exemptions" XLS (a retired CKAN dataset
that's still available for download, last updated 2012) and returns a set of
normalized addresses where the property is tax-exempt or tax-rebated under
one of seven categories:

    Municipal Capital Facility           - city-owned community facilities
    Charity Rebate                       - registered charities (schools,
                                            social services, religious orgs)
    Veteran Rebate                       - Royal Canadian Legion halls,
                                            Army/Navy/Air Force veterans clubs
    Exemption under Private Legislation  - universities, hospitals, etc.
    Ethno-Cultural Rebate                - cultural community organizations
    Exemption for Exhibition Buildings   - Exhibition Place / CNE / similar

677 unique addresses citywide (verified 2026-05-08 against parcels-top.json:
4 curated parcels matched, all institutional/non-residential - Royal Canadian
Legion Branch #1 at 243 Coxwell Ave being the headline catch).

Used as a HARD exclusion gate in `tools/build_parcels.py` (parallel to the
institutional / OSM landuse / TTC station gates). Catches institutional
buildings whose zoning permits residential redevelopment but whose actual
use makes them non-multiplex teardown candidates regardless.

Stable-but-stale: the city retired the dataset in ~2012, but the property
types it covers (Legion halls, registered charities, city facilities,
universities) rarely change ownership. Address-join is durable for the
overwhelming majority. New additions since 2012 are missed - we'd need a
manual blacklist or a successor city dataset to catch those.
