"""TTC station + transit-infrastructure exclusion via OpenStreetMap polygons.

Replaces the buffered-points heuristic in `tools/sources/ttc_stations.py`
(2026-05-06 first attempt - 30m buffer around 148 GTFS stops, missed
station-adjacent parcels like 9 Bedford Rd at 128m from St. George).

## Why OSM, not TTC

TTC publishes only GTFS (stop POINTS, route LINES) and a route-line
shapefile via Toronto Open Data. Their internal CAD/GIS with station
building polygons is not released (security: escape routes; legal:
leased land; internal: proprietary). OpenStreetMap contributors traced
TTC subway station footprints from the same satellite imagery the
city's Property Boundaries dataset is drawn against - so the polygons
match parcel geometry tightly. Toronto's OSM coverage of TTC
infrastructure is mature (10+ years).

## What we exclude

- TTC subway stations (Lines 1, 2, 4 - Yonge-University, Bloor-Danforth, Sheppard)
- Subway-station building footprints (the main station box + ancillary
  ventilation / mechanical buildings within 200m)
- Bus terminals attached to subway stations (Kipling, Kennedy, Don Mills, etc.)
- Streetcar barns / depots (Russell Yard, Roncesvalles Carhouse, etc.)

## What we DON'T exclude (separate concerns)

- GO Train stations (Metrolinx, not TTC; a separate dataset issue)
- Light rail stations (Eglinton Crosstown - soon-to-open; user may want
  these excluded later but the data isn't stable yet since the line is
  pre-revenue)
- TTC operations / admin buildings not adjacent to revenue stations

## Caching + freshness

Overpass API responses are cached to `tools/cache/osm_ttc_stations.geojson`.
Re-fetched only when the cached file is missing OR older than the rebuild
cadence (~weekly+). Manual cache bust: delete the file before next rebuild.

## Wire impact

No new wire field - hard-exclusion gate. `meta.stats.skippedTtcStation`
counter (already added in the 2026-05-06 first iteration) measures gate
effectiveness.
