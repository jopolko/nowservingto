"""Toronto 3D Massing source - building footprints + heights for shadow analysis.

Per Task 3 of the parcel-multiplex-readiness spec, the CKAN dataset ships annual
Shapefile snapshots in 19 resources; we use the 2025 vintage (the latest, no
2024 snapshot exists). See `tools/README.md` § 3D Massing Source for the
trade-off vs. the Multipatch sibling and the **EPSG:3857-trap** the filename
hides.

Loaded data is **ETL-only** - the 3D footprints + heights inform per-parcel
`solarScore` shadow attenuation in `tools/shadow_analysis.py` and never reach
the wire format. The browser sees a single shadow-adjusted scalar per parcel,
not the underlying geometry. (Per CLAUDE.md: "the 'no 3D' rule is about the
wire format and the browser, not the workstation ETL.")

Geometry is reprojected from EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator metres) → EPSG:4326
on ingest so the resulting polygons align with parcels (already in WGS84).
Without this reprojection, every shadow query would silently miss because the
coordinate magnitudes don't overlap.
