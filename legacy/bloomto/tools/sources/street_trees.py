"""Toronto Street Tree General - per-parcel mature-canopy signal.

City of Toronto's "Street Tree Data" CKAN dataset is a per-tree point cloud
of every city-owned street tree (~700K points), each carrying its botanical
name and DBH_TRUNK (diameter at breast height, in cm). For BloomTO's
parcel-level developer use case, DBH ≥ 30 cm matters because:

- Toronto's Tree Bylaw (Municipal Code Chapter 813) makes any tree of DBH
  ≥ 30 cm on private property a permit gate for removal - a developer
  intending to demolish the existing structure typically needs a Section 7
  permit to remove a regulated street tree adjacent to the work site.
- City-owned trees with DBH ≥ 40 cm on city land qualify as "heritage trees"
  with stronger protection.

We cache the 343 MB GeoJSON once, stream-parse via ijson (no full load), and
emit a STRtree of points + a parallel DBH list. `build_parcels.py` queries
trees inside the parcel polygon's expanded bounding box, counts those within
a 6-metre buffer of the polygon (close enough to be the parcel's "frontage
canopy"), and emits two per-parcel fields:
  - streetTreeCount: total trees on/adjacent to the lot
  - matureTreeCount: subset with DBH ≥ 30 cm (Tree Bylaw protection)

This is a TRUE per-parcel canopy signal, not the dissolved-by-neighborhood
proxy from the FLC dataset. Private-side trees are not in this feed (Toronto
Open Data only inventories city-owned trees), so a parcel with 0 hits may
still have private mature canopy - the field is "city-side mature canopy
on/near the lot," not "all canopy."
