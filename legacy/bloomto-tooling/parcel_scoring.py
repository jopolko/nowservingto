"""Parcel scoring constants - solar methodology disclosure only.

2026-05-07 cleanup: this module previously held the BloomTO-synthesised
`score`, `softScore`, and `bloom_flag` formulas. Per the trust-erosion
discussion (every weighted formula papered over data gaps), those have
all been removed from the wire format, the ETL, and the UI. The
remaining content is the SolarTO methodology disclosure - surfaced on
the wire as `meta.solarMethodology` so any consumer can read what
city-sourced inputs feed the (city-published) `solarScore` field.

Stdlib only. Kept as a separate module purely so the disclosure string
isn't buried inside `build_parcels.py`.
