"""Address Points - Toronto One Address Repository (CKAN, daily).

Toronto's `address-points-municipal-toronto-one-address-repository` dataset
publishes every municipal address point as a GeoJSON feature with the
canonical street number, sub-suffix (e.g., `A` / `B`), and centroid
coordinates. Daily-refreshed; ~860K records citywide.

## Why we care

The structure-type problem is the biggest data-quality gap in BloomTO's
broader cohort: 12,377 parcels are classifier-derived (~76% accurate) and
the cross-boundary classifier underclaims detached in suburbs (garages
within 1.5m trigger false-attached).

Address Points gives a clean ground-truth signal: **a parcel polygon
that contains ≥2 distinct address points is almost certainly attached
housing.** Two semi-detached units share a parcel polygon and get assigned
addresses like "100" + "100A" or "100" + "102". A row of 4 townhomes on
one parcel polygon has 4 address points. A standalone detached house has
exactly 1.

## Pipeline shape

`tools/build_parcels.py` calls `build_address_points_index(cache_dir)`
once at startup, then for each parcel polygon does a spatial-tree query
to count distinct address points inside. The result is consumed by the
structure-type waterfall as a NEW tier between OSM and the cross-boundary
classifier:

    permit  →  osm  →  address_points  →  classifier  →  vacant

The address_points tier ONLY produces "semi" or "row" verdicts (never
"detached" - single-point parcels just pass through to the next tier so
the classifier still gets to weigh in on their detached/attached call).
That preserves the precision of the existing ground-truth sources while
filling the suburban-detached false-attached gap with new attached truth.

## Cache

Single GeoJSON file ~80MB on disk; refreshed every 24h. The CKAN dataset
has no datastore-active CSV, so we fetch the GeoJSON resource directly
via HTTPS. Streamed to disk to avoid OOM.
