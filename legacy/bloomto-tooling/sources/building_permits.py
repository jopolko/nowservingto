"""Toronto Building Permits - Active Permits source loader.

Pulls Toronto's `building-permits-active-permits` CKAN dataset (CSV, ~50-80MB),
filters to residential new-build / conversion permits, and produces a
`PermitIndex` for `tools/build_parcels.py` to join against parcels.

## Wire-side adaptations from the spec (2026-05-04)

The spec at `.claude/specs/building-permits-source/` was written assuming the
CKAN feed carried lat/lng + floor_area_m2. The actual CSV (verified
2026-05-04) carries neither. Two pragmatic adaptations:

1. **No lat/lng → no spatial-fallback.** The CSV ships STREET_NUM +
   STREET_NAME + STREET_TYPE + STREET_DIRECTION pieces, no centroid. We
   reconstruct the address from those pieces and join via `_address.normalize_address`.
   The `PermitIndex.spatial_tree` still exists (empty STRtree) so callers
   can stay shape-compatible with `HeritageIndex`, but the orchestrator
   skips the spatial-fallback phase (every claim is `denominatorSource =
   "address_join"`). The `"spatial_fallback"` and `"mixed"` enum values
   become unreachable; the `validate()` enum check still accepts them
   so a future ETL upgrade can re-enable them without a wire-format break.

2. **No FLOOR_AREA → per-unit denominator instead of per-m².** The CSV ships
   DWELLING_UNITS_CREATED. The per-neighborhood metric becomes
   `medianCostPerUnit` (CAD per dwelling unit created), keeping the same
   sample-size guard. Per-unit is arguably more dev-relevant than per-m²
   anyway: developers ask "what does it cost to build a unit in this
   neighborhood?" not "what's the cost per square meter of bedroom + closet
   + mechanical room?" `meta.permits.denominatorLabel` is unchanged
   (`"declared_construction_cost_cad"` describes the value, not the
   denominator); a sibling key `denominatorPerUnit: true` documents the shift.

## Classifier

The closed-set `PERMIT_CATEGORY_TABLE` keys on the CSV's `PERMIT_TYPE` field
(verified values from the 2026-05-04 sample include "New Building",
"Small Residential Projects", etc.). Combined with `DWELLING_UNITS_CREATED > 0`
the loader keeps any permit that creates net-new dwelling units. That's the
"is this multiplex-relevant" gate.
