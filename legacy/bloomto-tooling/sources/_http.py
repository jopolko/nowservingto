"""Shared download helper for v1.2 source modules.

`download_with_retries` streams an HTTP response to a temp file beside the
destination, then atomically renames into place via `os.replace`. If the
network drops mid-stream or the request fails after all retries, the temp
file is unlinked and `dest` is left untouched (or absent, if it didn't
already exist) - never partially overwritten.

The eight v1.1 source modules each carry their own copy of the verbatim
retry pattern (see e.g. `neighborhoods.py:_download_with_retries`). This
helper is the lifted form. v1.2 modules (`heritage.py`, `building_outlines.py`,
`massing.py`) consume it directly. The v1.1 duplicates stay put for this
release - they're slated for cleanup in v1.3 and refactoring them now would
require re-running the 39-test suite for no v1.2 benefit.
