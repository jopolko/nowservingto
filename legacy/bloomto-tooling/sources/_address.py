"""Shared address normalizer for cross-source spatial joins.

Lifted byte-equivalent from `tools/sources/heritage.py` 2026-05-04 so both the
Heritage Register loader and the Building Permits loader can canonicalize
addresses through the same closed-set logic. A future heritage-only fix to
one of the abbreviation entries would otherwise silently change permit-join
behavior - the shared module makes both consumers move together by design.

Scope is intentionally minimal (only the normalizer + the abbreviation set);
heritage-domain helpers (KNOWN_STATUSES, more_restrictive, etc.) stay in
heritage.py because they have no analog in permits.
