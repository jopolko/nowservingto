"""Regression audit - known false-positive parcels must NOT appear in elite.

Accumulates the full list of parcels we've identified through manual spot-
checking as "structurally not multiplex teardowns" - schools, station
infrastructure, government buildings, parking lots, parkettes, etc. The
audit fails (exit non-zero) if any of them re-enters `data/parcels-top.json`.

Run after every projection. Wire into the cron / rebuild pipeline so a
regression in the curation logic surfaces loudly instead of slipping into
the live data.

Each entry pairs `parcelId` (the authoritative key - never changes even if
the address typography drifts) with a brief reason. Address fallback is
provided for parcels where we don't have a stable parcelId on hand.

Usage:
    .venv/bin/python tools/audit_known_false_positives.py
    .venv/bin/python tools/audit_known_false_positives.py --in data/parcels-top.json

Add a new false positive:
    1. Find the parcelId from `data/parcels-top.json` (or the address row).
    2. Append a row to `KNOWN_FALSE_POSITIVES` below with one-line reason.
    3. Run the script - it should pass.
    4. Commit. Future regressions on that parcel will fail the audit.
