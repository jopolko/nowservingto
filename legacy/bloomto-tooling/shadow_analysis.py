"""Per-parcel shadow analysis (three-tier algorithm).

For each parcel, query the 3D Massing STRtree for nearby buildings, classify
each candidate into one of three tiers based on data availability, and
return a `ShadowResult(unshadowed_fraction, quality)`. Quality follows
design.md §147 / §354's accuracy-over-completeness rule:

  - "measured":    all candidates have valid footprint + height
  - "estimated":   at least one candidate falls back to the conservative envelope
  - "unavailable": no candidate has a usable height - orchestrator sets
                   `solarScore = None`, never guesses

The projection is **planar** at Toronto's latitude (43.7°N) - the design's
"flat-earth is fine" approximation, which avoids reaching for `pyproj` and
works because parcels are O(50 m) wide and the per-degree distance error
across that span is sub-metre. Sun direction at azimuth `a` (degrees, North = 0
clockwise) means the sun is *at* that bearing - shadows fall in the *opposite*
direction. For Toronto noon, the sun is south (azimuth 180°), so shadows
extend north.

The reference angles are the winter and summer solstice noon. Averaging
gives a year-round shadow proxy without paying for an annual ray trace.
