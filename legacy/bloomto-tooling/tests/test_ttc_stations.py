"""Smoke + correctness tests for `tools.sources.ttc_stations`.

The exclusion gate uses real TTC subway-stop coordinates (not synthetic
fixtures) because the buffered geometry is the actual product behavior.
The 22 Chester Ave coordinates from the 2026-05-05 audit are the canary:
they MUST be excluded by the gate. A single-point true-residential parcel
several km from any subway stop MUST NOT be excluded.
