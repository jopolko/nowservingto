# service contractor (Aramark, Compass Group, Sodexo, TMU, hospital systems),
# or (d) a grocery/retail-food chain (Loblaws, Metro, Bulk Barn, Walmart).
# None of these belong in a "newest INDEPENDENT cultural-cuisine restaurants"
# directory. This complements is_chain() (which keys off the consumer brand
# name) by catching B2B operators whose Operating Name isn't a known consumer
# brand at all - Aramark cafeterias inside hospitals, TMU food courts, etc.
# REMOVED 2026-05-14: hardcoded ≥10-licence Client Name threshold. The
# validator now sees Client Name directly and judges institutional/chain
# from corporation identity + Places types + reviews. No magic threshold.
