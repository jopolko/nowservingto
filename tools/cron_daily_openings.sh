# Daily cron: refresh the "Now open" feed.
#
#   1. Pull fresh Toronto Open Data business licences CSV
#   2. Inject openings (uses LLM + Places caches; cuisine + websites where cached)
#   3. Classify any NEW openings not yet in LLM cache (Anthropic Batch API)
#   4. Re-inject so newly-tagged businesses surface
#   5. Look up websites for newly cuisine-tagged businesses (Haiku + web_search)
#   6. Re-inject one more time to merge in any new website data
#   7. Optionally rsync data/corridors.json to prod
#
# Safe for cron:
#   - flock against concurrent runs
#   - rotates its own logs to tools/logs/openings-*.log
#   - exits non-zero on hard failure so cron MAILTO catches it
#   - per-step failure is logged but doesn't abort downstream steps where possible
#
# Optional env (override at the cron line):
#   ROOTED_DIR    repo root (default: derived from this script)
#   WEB_ROOT      local prod dir for `cp` deploy (e.g. /var/www/html/nowservingto)
#   SKIP_LLM      "1" to skip the Haiku classification step
#   SKIP_WEBSITES "1" to skip the web_search website-lookup step
#
# Suggested cron line (every morning 5:17 AM Toronto):
#   17 5 * * *  WEB_ROOT=/var/www/html/nowservingto /var/www/html/nowservingto/tools/cron_daily_openings.sh
